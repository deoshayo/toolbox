The [School of Data Handbook](https://schoolofdata.org/handbook/) advises us that:

> While there are many different types of data, almost all processing can be expressed as a set of incremental stages. The most common stages include data acquisition, extraction, cleaning, transformation, integration, analysis and presentation. Of course, with many smaller projects, not each of these stages may be necessary.

Each of these *stages* is covered by multiple tools and methods, and every "data wrangler" will have their own favorites, furnished by experience, expertise, the day's fashion, or just good old preference.

> “I want to suggest that to write to your best abilities, it behooves you to construct your own toolbox and then build up enough muscle so you can carry it with you. Then, instead of looking at a hard job and getting discouraged, you will perhaps seize the correct tool and get immediately to work.”
― Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft

This website makes some suggestions of which tools are useful for each stage of the process of data wrangling. It is a community curated site which you can edit via [GitHub](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch), or just send us any suggestions or change requests.

In our workshops and Data Expeditions, we cover tools like this - and introduce some of the principles by which the [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/) has helped thousands of people around the world to become *data literate*: to go beyond making decisions from charts and factoids, to discover and delight in worlds of information as we go beyond surface level.

Please [contact us](https://schoolofdata-ch.github.io/#contact) in case of any questions. Sign up to our [public forum](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch) or [newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/schoolofdata-ch) to be notified of upcoming [Expeditions](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/c/expeditions) and other [Events](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/c/events). Invite your friends / colleagues / family too, they will thank you!
